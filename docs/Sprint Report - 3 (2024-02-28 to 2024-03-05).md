## Sprint Retrospective

During this sprint, we made considerable progress on the game's development, completing essential user stories related to mana management, unit movement, enemy attacks, spell casting, and victory conditions. The sprint revealed areas for enhancement, particularly in advancing the spell card system, improving AI, and aligning team members' design frameworks more closely. Despite facing challenges, we successfully completed many user stories which marks a positive step towards the game's development.

## Action Items

- Need to complete card and AI logic to finish the game.
