## Challenges Faced

**Qin, Xuesen**:

- Encountered difficulties while completing YoungFlamewing, unable to select all boards when implementing fly logic. with the help of the team leader, the issue was resolved.
- Implementing the ability of GloomChaser requires associating multiple classes, which took some time to solve
- There was a misunderstanding about Silverguard Squire's abilities when implementing it, which was resolved through group discussion

**Tsai, Yi Hsiu**:

- While designing the Provoke skill, I used an interface in its design but was still unfamiliar with its use and spent a lot of time understanding its logic. However, I ultimately succeeded in completing it. I'm also not familiar with the @test function in Unit tests.

**Wu, Fangxu**:

- In the case of multiple deathWatches, some effects are not displayed in the game.
- For Bloodmoon Priestess, there is a problem in traversing surrounding units.
- There is a problem with handling the breakthrough of the maximum health limit

**Xu, Haifan**:

- Encountered multiple bugs, especially ConcurrentModificationException.

**Bao, Jingzhen**:

- There were obstacles to perfecting the logic of the card code, and the setting of some variables conflicted with other parts of the code.

## Sprint Retrospective

During this sprint, the team made significant progress in the development of the game. Each team member completed its assigned key User Stories. Some challenges were encountered, such as dealing with bugs and obstacles with card code logic, but team members were generally able to overcome them through group discussions and support from the team leader. Despite facing difficulties with particular skills, we were successful in completing most tasks and have learned a lot.

We now have produced a functioning and working game, despite some minor known issues.
