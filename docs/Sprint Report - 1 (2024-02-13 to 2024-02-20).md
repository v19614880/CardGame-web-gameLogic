## Summary

[A reference to the user stories](docs/User%20Stories.md)

We had a mixed week with some members diving into the project while others struggled with understanding the code structure. Despite some challenges with compatibility and absence, most managed to create personal branches and make progress. Understanding the project logic remained difficult for many. Completing assigned tasks and improving familiarity with the project structure are our next key target. Overall, the team is determined to catch up on missed ground and push forward in the upcoming sprints.

## Challenges Faced

**Qin, Xuesen**:

- Hard to understand the code.
- Don't know how to start.

**Tsai, Yi Hsiu**:

- Java version not compatible with the project.
- Hard to understand the code.

**Wu, Fangxu**:

- Java version not compatible, need to redeploy the java environment.

**Xu, Haifan**:

- Modified the class design based on the feedback received from the tutor.
- Still learning the project structure.
- It's troublesome to integrate our class design, to the template and figure out a way to make it work with each other.

**Bao, Jingzhen**:

- **Absent**

## Sprint Retrospective

Team members were actively participated in the project. However, one member is absent. Everyone else were able to follow through the branching strategy and learned how to create separate branch for development.

One key issue is that most of us found it difficult to understand the code logic of the project template and don't know where to start.

Some of us don't have much time for this sprint and need to catch up the progress in the future sprints.

## Action Items

- Complete the assigned user stories as much as possible.

## Next Steps

- Continue studying the project structure.
- Finishing up the initialization process so that other user stories can take place.
