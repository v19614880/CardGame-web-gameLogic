- Understanding and correctly calling methods of different classes is still difficult
- Ideas for implementing function diverge from the group members

**Tsai, Yi Hsiu**:

- Still unfamiliar with the game structure
- Wrote duplicate code for the same functionality
- Havenâ€™t tested the completed code

**Wu, Fangxu**:

- The code is not standardized enough
- There is some confusion in the running logic
- Only the framework is completed, and the detailed code still needs to be improved before it can run.

**Xu, Haifan**:

- Need to help other team members with their user stories

**Bao, Jingzhen**:

## Sprint Retrospective

During this sprint, our team experienced a mix of successes and obstacles. We made good progress on vital tasks like showing mana, setting up avatars, and managing cards. However, we also faced challenges such as grasping the complex codebase, differing ideas on how to implement features, and some team members struggling with understanding the game structure. Issues like miscommunication on class methods and the need to standardize code are our main challenges. Moving forward, we aim to work closely on aligning our approaches, improving code comprehension, and enhancing communication to ensure smoother progress in the upcoming sprint.

## Action Items

- Need to complete the game flow logic as soon as possible.
- Take on more user stories
- Behind schedule already, need to catch up.
